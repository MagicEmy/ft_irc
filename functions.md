#	Socket Functions:
socket:	Creates a new communication endpoint (socket).
close:	Closes a socket descriptor.
##	Socket Options Functions:
setsockopt:	Set socket options, such as setting socket-level options like SO_REUSEADDR.
##	Address Conversion Functions:
getsockname:	Gets the local address of a socket.
getprotobyname:	Gets protocol information by its name.
gethostbyname:	Gets host information by its name (IPv4).
getaddrinfo:	Gets address information based on host and service (IPv6 support).
freeaddrinfo:	Frees the memory allocated by getaddrinfo.
##	Socket Binding and Connection Functions:
bind:		Binds a socket to a specific address and port.
connect:	Initiates a connection on a socket.
listen:		Marks a socket as passive and ready to accept incoming connections.
accept:		Accepts an incoming connection request, creating a new connected socket.

#	Network Byte Order Conversion Functions:
htons:	Converts a short integer (16 bits) from host byte order to network byte order (big-endian).
htonl:	Converts a long integer (32 bits) from host byte order to network byte order (big-endian).
ntohs:	Converts a short integer (16 bits) from network byte order to host byte order.
ntohl:	Converts a long integer (32 bits) from network byte order to host byte order.

#	Internet Address Functions:
inet_addr:	Converts a string IPv4 address to a network byte order (binary) representation.
inet_ntoa:	Converts a network byte order (binary) representation of an IPv4 address to a string.

#	Sending and Receiving Data Functions:
send:	Sends data on a connected socket.
recv:	Receives data from a connected socket.

#	Signal Handling Functions:
signal:	Sets a function to handle a specific signal.
sigaction:	Sets a function to handle a specific signal with extended features.

#	File Functions (For File Descriptor I/O):
lseek:	Moves the file pointer to a specific location in a file.
fstat:	Gets file status information.
fcntl:	Performs various operations on file descriptors.

#	Polling Functions:
